[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rnons/ordered-containers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rnons/ordered-containers)

An Elm library that provides `OrderedDict` and `OrderedSet` data structures.

`OrderedDict` is similar to `Dict`, `OrderedSet` is similar to `Set`. The difference is when iterated or converted to a `List`, the order will be the same as the order they were inserted.
